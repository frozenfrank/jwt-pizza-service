# Incident: 2024-12-01 10:37:50

## Summary

Between the hours of 10:31 and 10:57 am MST on Sunday, Dec 12th, 0 users encountered errors when ordering pizzas through the JWT pizza service. The errors were triggered by an outage of the external JWT Pizza Factory sometime between 10:31 and 10:37. The failure was initiated because of a voluntary request for chaos testing of the system.

JWT Pizza Service is dependent on JWT Pizza Factory to sign and acknowledge pizza orders. The outage was detected by Grafana alerts monitoring a non-zero rate of pizza failures. The team started working on the event by reviewing error log data on the JWT Pizza Service Dashboard to locate the resolution URL which ended the chaos. Because the automated monitoring alerted of the errors, this critical incident affected 0% of users.

There was no further impact of this incident. Logs indicate that only our health checks were using the system during the time of the outage.

## Detection

This incident was detected when the Pizza Factory Failure alarm was triggered and the JWT Pizza OnCall time (James Finlinson) was paged.

The event may have been detected sooner with more frequent health checks. The interval of 10 minutes contributed to a total potential down time of 20 minutes. However, we have decided that the 10 minute interval provided sufficient notice of the behavior. No configuration changes will be made.

After receiving the alert, the response could have been quickened by using more convenient tools. Accessing the dashboard on a mobile phone presented UI issues scrolling to the end of the log message to copy the report URL. Creativity had to be employed to open the logs in a different window which allowed the string to be copied and sent to resolve the situation. A new policy that responding individual access the dashboard from fully capable devices such as laptops and computers will reduce this time in the future.

## Response

After receiving a page at {17:38 UTC}, James Finlinson came online at 17:42 UTC in Grafana OnCall IRM.

The engineer immediately began using a mobile device to view the logs and locate the resolution URL.

Because the alerting window was short, the alarm auto-resolved itself and fired again when the next round of health checks came through.

# Root cause

This was caused by voluntary submission to chaos testing to test the responsiveness of the alerting system. The situation was resolved in a reasonable amount of time, although the time could have been reduced with more frequent health checks and more capable devices during the response.

## Resolution

The team had been prepared in advance to handle this kind of system failure. Prior preparation and knowledge of how the Pizza Factory would fail had informed the team to look for a report URL that would resolve the situation.

By leveraging the Grafana logs panel that filters out the error logs, the team was able to quickly locate the logs that contained the report URL. At this point, the most difficult portion was figuring out how to copy the url to the clipboard from a mobile device to submit back to the factory.

If this were to become a regular occurrence, we could automate the recovery by reading the report URL from the logs and automatically submitting it without any manual intervention.
